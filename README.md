# Medical-Image-Classification-using-Vision-Transformers-for-CT-and-X-ray-Images

This repository focuses on the development and implementation of a medical image classification system using vision transformers specifically for CT and X-ray images. CT and X-ray imaging are commonly used in medical diagnosis and treatment, and accurate classification of these images is essential for providing the correct treatment plan for patients.

The project aims to explore the effectiveness of vision transformers in accurately classifying CT and X-ray images into different categories based on the underlying medical conditions. The dataset used for training and evaluation will specifically include CT and X-ray images, and the models developed in this project will be tailored to these image modalities.

The repository provide a detailed documentation and code to enable the reproduction of the experiments conducted in the study. Additionally, it will also provide pre-trained models and scripts for evaluating new CT and X-ray images using the developed system. The code and models developed in this repository will be made available to the public to facilitate further research and development in the field of medical image classification using vision transformers for CT and X-ray images.
